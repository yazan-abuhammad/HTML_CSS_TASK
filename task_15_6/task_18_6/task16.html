    <p>his is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an
        <br>
        empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but 
        <br>
        he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few
        <br>
        things in the box.</p>
       <p> Jack would really like....</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic trik</li>
        <li>Anything pokemon</li>
        <li>a motorized lego set</li>
        </ul>
        You can get all this (and more) at an online toy
        store. Two very popular ones are <a href="#">toysrus.com</a> and
        <a href="#">eTOYS</a>.
